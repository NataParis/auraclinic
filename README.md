## Positioning of elements

This project is based on mixed approach using the Bootstrap framework for galleries as well as flex and grid based positioning

## Adoptive design 

The loffowing sizes should be used in media queries: 
- Mobile L: max-width 425px;
- Tablet: min-width: 768px and max-width: 1023px;
- Desktop: min-width: 1024px;

## BEM methodology

BEM assumes the division of your components to blocks, elements and modificators. This allows better recognition of classes used in code and supports simplier application of styles in templates

#### Example of classes structure BEM:
- `.block` - parent block like `.product-card`.
- `.block__element` - element inside parent block like `.product-card__title`.
- `.block--modifier` - block modificator with special feature like `.product-card--highlighted`.

### SCSS (Sass) Files structure
Files of SCSS type are placed in folder style and divided into smaller subtypes for simplier hierarchy of style support:
- `style.scss` - main SCSS file uniting all style components
- `_vars.scss` - variables like color, siwes, fonts 
- `_mixins.scss`- file for repetitive styles
- `_template.scss` - file for basic blocks of website used in the same format on different pages 
- `_components.scss` - file with styles for small repetitive components like buttons, product/service cards, interactive fields
